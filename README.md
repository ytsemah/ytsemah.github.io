# About me
## My interests
-I like videogames, the arts, and consuming various forms of visual entertainment.
## Cool websites
[Hypercalc](https://www.mrob.com/pub/comp/hypercalc/hypercalc-javascript.html)-An advanced calculator that displays numbers unconcievably larger than the ones shown in ordinary scientific calculators, I find it fascinating how my human mind cannot possibly wrap my head around them.  
[Colordesigner](https://colordesigner.io/)- A website that lets you choose color combinations for various things, I like to mess around and see how different colors look together.
