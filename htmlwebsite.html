    <h2 style="font-family: 'VCR OSD Mono', sans-serif;">The Greatest Sandwich Ever Made</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 36px;">When I was younger, I had no parents, no food, no hobbies, no job, and no money. All I
      had was this sandwich recipe that I've carried on a sticky note for the past several years
      in my back pocket. <br><br> It has always been there my entire life, and has somehow stayed with me even though it
      has been set on fire several times. Ever since the Incident I knew that
      everything I ever had would dissapear from me, except this single crumpled recipe. <br><br>One day I managed to
      make this sandwich following the exact recipe, and immediately after the first bite my
      parents returned home, my cancer was cured, I found my lost dog and I won the lottery for 1 billion dollars. The
      sandwich was so good that I made one for my best friend (who was no longer dead)
      and moments later she got a call from every single job she applied to, announcing her the new CEO. <br><br> A few
      days later the FBI showed up to my 500 million dollar mansion demanding that I hand over
      the sticky note, so I gave them a copy of the recipe I scribbled down on an index card. Apparently someone from
      the government wanted to start a restaurant, but last I heard it closed down.
      It might have been because my handwriting isn't good and "mg" and "kg" look similar. Nowadays, I am currently on
      the run because They know I still have the original copy of the recipe, and by
      creating this webpage I hope the sandwich lives in our heart longer than I will live on this planet.

        <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li><s>Human souls</s></li>
        <li>Air fryer</li>
        <li>20 minutes of spare time</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>First of all, if your bread looks like <img src="c:\Users\ytsemah\Desktop\CTI110\whitebread.png" height="24"
            width="32" /> what are you even doing. Go get better bread. Sourdough is best, but if you're on a budget I
          would recommend <a

            target="_blank">this tasty french bread</a>
          (or
          https://www.walmart.com/ip/Freshness-Guaranteed-French-Bread-14-oz/46491756?classType=REGULAR&athbdg=L1200&from=/search
          if the link doesn't work). </li>
        <br>
        <li> Place two slices of bread facedown in the air fryer and heat 375 degrees Farenheit for 2-3 minutes. The
          bread should be a bit crispy when finished.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Next, flip over each slice of bread and place 1 slice of cheddar and a handful of mozzarella on each slice
          (amount varies depending on the size of the bread slices.) Heat at 375 for 3 minutes, enough to melt the
          cheese.
          The cheese side must be face-up!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Third, place a few pinches of paprika, pepper and garlic powder (ideally in that order) on top of the
          cheese, then place slices of bread on top. It should look like a sandwich now. Heat at 375 for 3 more minutes.
        </li>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Eat!</li>

      <p style="font-size: 3335;"><img src="c:\Users\ytsemah\Desktop\CTI110\profile3.png" height="30" width="30" />I got in a car crash yesterday
        and broke 17 bones, but now my car is completely intact! Yesterday
        the doctors said I was going to be hospital-bound for months, but I made a full recovery! The sandwich itself
        tasted ok</p>
